# File-Transfer-Protocol ( FTP )

File Transfer Protocol(FTP) is an application layer protocol which moves files between local and remote file systems. It runs on the top of TCP, like HTTP. To transfer a file, 2 TCP connections are used by FTP in parallel: control connection and data connection.

But FTP is not just a protocol but it is also a program. FTP promotes sharing of files via remote computers with reliable and efficient data transfer.
