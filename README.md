# File-Transfer-Protocol ( FTP )

FTP stands for file transfer protocol. 

It is the protocol that actually lets us transfer files. It can facilitate this between any two machines using it. But FTP is not just a protocol but it is also a program. FTP promotes sharing of files via remote computers with reliable and efficient data transfer.
